# Part 1 ex 1.5

Start a ubuntu image with the process sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

You will notice that a few things required for proper execution are missing. Be sure to remind yourself which flags to use so that the read actually waits for input.

Note also that curl is NOT installed in the container yet. You will have to install it from inside of the container.

Test inputting helsinki.fi into the application. It should respond with something like

<html>

<head>
  <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
  <p>The document has moved <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">here</a>.</p>
</body>

</html>
This time return the command you used to start process and the command(s) you used to fix the ensuing problems.

This exercise has multiple solutions, if the curl for helsinki.fi works then it’s done. Can you figure out other (smart) solutions?


```bash
devops_with_docker ❯ docker container run -d -it --name 1_5 ubuntu:16.04 sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
devops_with_docker ❯ docker container exec -it 1_5 bash
root@f1d0217e509b:/# apt-get update
root@f1d0217e509b:/# apt-get install curl -y
root@f1d0217e509b:/# exit
devops_with_docker ❯ docker container attach 1_5
