# Part 1 ex 1.8
In this exercise we wonâ€™t create a new Dockerfile.
Image `devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise` has instructions 
to create a log into `/usr/app/logs.txt`. Start the container with
bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit your used commands for this exercise.

```bash
touch logs.txt
docker container run -v "$(pwd)/logs.txt:/usr/app/logs.txt" --rm --name 1-8 devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise
```
ps. This was also found in the logs
```
Secret message is:
"Volume bind mount is easy"
```
