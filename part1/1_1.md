# Part 1 ex 1.1 Getting Started

Since we already did “Hello, World!” in the material let’s do something else.

Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit, such as nginx, detached.

Stop 2 of the containers leaving 1 up.

Submitting the output for docker container ls -a is enough to prove this exercise has been done.

``` bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
9260a9fbde3a   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   30 seconds ago   Up 29 seconds   80/tcp    strange_dijkstra
```
